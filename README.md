# Synthetic-Enhancers-Library

1. Synthetic Enhancer Library.ipynb: simple code to generate random libraries of 50bp synthetic enhancers by picking transcription factor binding sites from a .csv file with a column with the transcription factor name and the another with its corresponding transcription factor binding site. 
2. Synthetic Enhancer Library.csv:: .csv file with an example of how to generate the libraries. In the example 4 transcription factors have been selected which are differentially active in mouse myoblast cells according to the ENCODE database, and whose binding sites have been identified with HOCOMOCO. The same operation can be carried out with potentially any cell-line.
